  name of exception classes)
* Add `--list-hooks` flag which displays all hooks for a repository and
  whether they are enabled/disabled
* Add `required_executable` and `install_command` options that allow a hook
  to define an executable that must be in the `PATH` in order for it to work,
  and a command the user can use to install the executable if it doesn't exist
* All built-in hooks will now fail if the required executable is not present

  broken symlink
* Add `BrokenSymlinks` pre-commit hook which checks for broken symlinks

## 0.16.0

  tree being lost

  but before the cleanup had finished would result in a lost working
  tree
* Handle edge case where if a file was created in the working directory by a
  separate process in between the working tree being reset and the stash being
  applied, the hook runner would silently fail
* Prevent stack traces from appearing during early interrupt before Overcommit

  configurations in hook implementations

  [travis-lint](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-lint) gem
* Display actual warning message when dependencies aren't satisfied in
  post-checkout `BundleCheck` hook

  ran them. See [Security](https://github.com/causes/overcommit#security)
  for more information
* Automatically update `overcommit-hook` master hook and any other symlinks
  before hook run. Run `overcommit --install` if you're upgrading to save

  You must now subclass `Overcommit::Hook::<Type>` and implement

  `.git/hooks` and install new ones with `overcommit --install`
* Configuration for repository can be specified via `.overcommit.yml` file
